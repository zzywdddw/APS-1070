<br>
Small K:  
- Good at capturing fine-grained patterns
- May overfit (excellent for training data, not that good for new data, too complex), i.e. be sensitive to random noise

Large K:  
- Makes stable prediction by averaging over lots of examples
- May underfit (not that good for  training data, not good for new data, too simple). i.e. fail to capture important regularities
